To test out the GitHub repo, locally on your own computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/sn-prompt-generator.git
cd sn-prompt-generator
bash copy-to-public-folder.sh
open public/index.html
```

The `index.html` file inside the `public` folder is the one that gets served "publicly" (i.e. on surge.sh).

## Version Notes

- [1.0.0](https://github.com/hchiam/sn-prompt-generator/tree/3cf92d7e4c7dedd926cf7496e7ae8c14e0a9b2e8): included many ["pure fun" prompts from kids](https://github.com/hchiam/sn-prompt-generator/blob/3cf92d7e4c7dedd926cf7496e7ae8c14e0a9b2e8/script.js#L150) that we kept _just for the start_ (there was a longer-term plan in mind since the beginning).
- [2.0.0](https://github.com/hchiam/sn-prompt-generator/releases/tag/2.0.0): Updated prompts to sustain active thinking for the whole sermon. Moved "main point" section to the bottom and replaced it with a "free space" for more flexibility. Tweaked printout sheet for subtle change cues.
