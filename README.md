To test out the GitHub repo, locally on your own computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hchiam/sn-prompt-generator.git
cd sn-prompt-generator
bash copy-to-public-folder.sh
open public/index.html
```

The `index.html` file inside the `public` folder is the one that gets served "publicly" (i.e. on glitch.com).
